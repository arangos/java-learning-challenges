## Intuition

The problem requires finding two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target. My first thought was to use a brute force approach, where I would check each pair of numbers to see if they add up to the target. However, this would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large arrays.

To optimize this, I realized that we can use a hash map to store numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array. By checking if the difference between the target and the current number exists in the map, we can find the solution in a single pass.

### Approach

Initialize an empty hash map (numToIndexMap) to store the numbers we've seen so far and their corresponding indices.
Iterate over the array using a for loop.
For each number nums[i], calculate the difference diff between the target and the current number (diff = target - nums[i]).
Check if diff exists in numToIndexMap. If it does, it means we've found the two numbers that add up to the target. Return their indices [i, numToIndexMap.get(diff)].
If diff does not exist in the map, store the current number and its index in numToIndexMap.
If no such pair is found by the end of the loop, return null. (Though according to the problem constraints, a solution is guaranteed, so this case won't occur.)
Dry Run Of a Example
Input Array (nums): [2, 7, 11, 15] | Target: 9

---

Initial Setup:
The method initializes an empty HashMap called numToIndexMap to keep track of numbers and their indices.
It then iterates through the array to find two numbers that add up to the target value.

----

Iteration 1:
Index (i): 0
Current Number (nums[i]): 2
Difference (diff): 9 - 2 = 7
The numToIndexMap is empty at this point.
The method checks if 7 (the difference) is present in numToIndexMap. Since it is not, the check fails.
The method then adds the current number 2 and its index 0 to numToIndexMap: numToIndexMap = {2: 0}

----

Iteration 2:
Index (i): 1
Current Number (nums[i]): 7
Difference (diff): 9 - 7 = 2
The method checks if 2 (the difference) is present in numToIndexMap. This time, it finds that 2 is indeed in numToIndexMap, with an index of 0.
Since the difference is found in numToIndexMap, the method returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target: [1, 0].
The method successfully finds that the numbers at indices 0 and 1 (i.e., 2 and 7) add up to 9, which is the target value. Therefore, it returns [1, 0] as the result.

#### Complexity

Time complexity:

* The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once, and each lookup or insertion in the hash map takes O(1) time on average.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) because, in the worst case, we might store all the numbers in the hash map if no two numbers add up to the target until the last element.
